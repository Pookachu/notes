Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output.

## Basic Gates
- [[And Gate]]
- [[Or Gate]]
- [[Not Gate]]

## Universal Gates
- [[NAND Gate]]
- [[NOR Gate]]

## Connections
- These are built using [[Transistors]].
- They are used to create [[Combinational Logic Circuits]].
