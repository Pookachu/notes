#### Definition of the Derivative

> The derivative of a function , denoted as , is the [[limit]] of the [[difference quotient]] as the interval width approaches zero. It represents the functions instantaneous rate of change at a specific point. 
$$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$

#### Core interpretation 

> The derivative has two primary interpretations that are crucial to understand:

1. **Geometric Interpretation (Slope of the [[tangent]] line)**
	The derivative $f'(x)$ gives the **slope of the line tangent** to the graph of $f(x)$ at the point where $x=a$. This is the most important visual and conceptual meaning of the derivative.

2. **Physical interpretation (Instantaneous Rate of Change)**
	The derivative measures how fast a function's output is changing relative to its input. If $f(t)$ represents an object's position at time $t$, then the derivative $f'(t)$ represents its instantaneous **velocity** at time $t$.

#### Fundamental Differentiation Rules
	These are the essential shortcuts for finding derivatives without using the limit definition every time.
