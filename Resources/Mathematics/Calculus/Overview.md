`From sec 2.1`

**Calculus is looking at average vs instantaneous rates of change**
- We care a lot about what types of change things are
- We can calculate the [[Difference Quotient|slope]] of a line if we have 2 points
- For [[Difference Quotient|slope]] of a line we use the variable $m$ generally
$$m = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{y}}$$
## A [[Difference Quotient|slope]] is a rate

[[Secant line]] of a function is looking at the change between two points of a function

[[Tangent line]] of a function is looking at the instantaneous rate of change of a point on a function
