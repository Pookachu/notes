`A difference quotient is a rate of change`
Given that a slope of a line can be found with the following equation
$$\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2-x_1} \space or \space \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
This equation gives you $m$ (slope) in the equation of a line $$y=mx+b$$
Next, given that $f(x) = y$, we can say that the slope of a line can be:
$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}$$
Or, simplified:
$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
Where $h =0$ you get a [[Tangent line]] at $(x, f(x))$
Where $h \neq 0$ you get a [[Secant line]] between $(x, f(x))$ and $(x+h, f(x+h))$
