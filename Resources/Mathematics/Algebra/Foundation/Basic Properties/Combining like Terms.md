This is a key part of simplifying. **Like terms** are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. You can add or subtract their coefficients.

**Example:** In the expression $4x^2 +2y −x^2 +3y$, you can combine the $x^2$ terms and the $y$ terms.

- $4x^2−x^2$ = $3x^2$

- $2y+3y=5y$


The simplified expression is $3x^2 +5y$.
