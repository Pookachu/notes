#### Anatomy

> An **inequality** is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions that are not necessarily equal. It asserts that one value is greater than, less than, or not equal to another.

The core of an inequality is the **relational operator**:
- $>$ : Greater than
- $<$ : Less than
- $\geq$ Greater than or equal to
- $\leq$ Less than or equal to
- $\neq$ Not equal to

> An inequality has two sides, just like an equation, with an expression on the left and an expression on the right of the operator.

#### Rules and Properties for Solving Inequalities

> The main goal when solving an inequality is to isolate the variable. The rules are very similar to solving equations, with one crucial exception.

##### **Addition and Subtraction Property**
> You can **add or subtract** the same number from both sides of an inequality without changing the direction of the inequality sign.
- If $a>b$, then $a+c>b+c$ and $a−c>b−c$.
	**Example:** $$ 
	\begin{aligned} 
	x +5 &> 12 \\
	x +5 -5 &> 12 - 5 \\
	x &> 7 \\
	\end{aligned} $$
##### Multiplication and Division Property
> This is the most important rule to remember.
1. Multiplying or dividing both sides by a **positive number** leaves the inequality sign **unchanged**.
2. Multiplying or dividing both sides by **negative number** requires you to **flip the direction of the inequality sign.**
	**Example (Positive Number):** $$\begin{aligned} 
	4x \space \leq& \space20 \\
	{4x \over 4} \space \leq&  \space {20 \over 4} \\
	 x \space \leq&  \space 5
	\end{aligned}$$
	**Example (Negative Number):** $$\begin{aligned}
	-3x \space <& \space 18 \\
	{-3x \over -3} \space >& \space {18\over-3} \space \text{(sign flips!)}\\
	 x >& -6 \\
	\end{aligned}$$
##### Transitive Property 
> If a first value is related to a second, and the second is related to a third in the same way, then the first value is also related to the third.
- If $a>b$ and $b>c$, then $a>c$.

#### Important Concepts to Know
##### Graphing on a Number Line

> Graphing is a great way to visualize the solution set of an inequality.

- **Open Circle ($\circ$):** Used for $<$ and $>$ to show that the endpoint is **not** included in the solution.

- **Closed Circle ($\bullet$):** Used for $\leq$ and $\geq$ to show that the endpoint **is** included in the solution.

##### Interval Notation

> Interval notation is the standard way to write the solution set.

- **Parentheses $(\space )$**: Used for endpoints that are **not** included (corresponds to an open circle).

- **Square Brackets $[\space]$**: Used for endpoints that **are** included (corresponds to a closed circle).

- Infinity ($\infty$) and negative infinity ($-\infty$) always use parentheses.

| Inequality      | Interval notation |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| $x > 7$         | $(7, \infty)$     |
| $x \leq 5$      | $(-\infty, 5]$    |
| $-6 < x \leq 5$ | $(-6, 5]$         |
#### Compound Inequalities
> These are inequalities with multiple conditions joined by "and" or "or".

- **AND Inequalities**: Represent an _intersection_ of sets. The variable must satisfy both conditions. They are often written in a compact form.
    
    - **Example:** $−2≤x<4$. This means $x≥−2$ AND $x<4$. The solution is the overlapping region.

- **OR Inequalities**: Represent a _union_ of sets. The variable can satisfy one condition, the other, or both. They are written as two separate inequalities.
    
    - **Example:** $x<−6$ or $x>7$. The solution includes all numbers in both sets.
