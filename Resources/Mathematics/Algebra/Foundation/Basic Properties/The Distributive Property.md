  - Distributive Property
---
This property is crucial for both simplifying expressions and for factoring. 
It allows you to multiply a single term by a group of terms inside parentheses.
	**Formula:** $$a(b+c)=ab+ac$$
		**Example:** $$3(x+4) \to (3 \cdot x) + (3 \cdot 4) \to 3x+12$$

**Factoring Example:** $5x−15$ can be factored by "undistributing" the common term, $5$, to get $5(x−3)$ .
