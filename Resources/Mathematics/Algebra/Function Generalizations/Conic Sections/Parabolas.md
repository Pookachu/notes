#### Overview
A [[Function]] whose graph is a U-shape

#### **Anatomy**
A parabola is a U-shaped curve defined by a special geometric property: **every point on the parabola is an equal distance from a fixed point (the focus) and a fixed line (the directrix).**

- **Vertex (h,k)**: The turning point of the parabola. It's the lowest point if it opens up, or the highest point if it opens down.

- **Focus**: A point on the inside of the curve. The parabola always "bends" around the focus.

- **Directrix**: A line on the outside of the curve. It is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry.

- **Axis of Symmetry**: The line that divides the parabola into two perfectly symmetrical halves. It always passes through the vertex and the focus.

- **Focal Length (p)**: The distance from the vertex to the focus (and also from the vertex to the directrix). This value determines how "wide" or "narrow" the parabola is.

#### **Equations**

The formulas for a parabola depend on its orientation (opening vertically or horizontally). The **Vertex Form** is the most useful for identifying the key features.

##### **Vertical Parabolas (Opening Up or Down)**

The variable that is squared is **x**.

- **Vertex Form:** $(x−h)^2=4p(y−k)$
    
    - **Vertex:** $(h,k)$
    
    - **Focus:** $(h,k+p)$
    
    - **Directrix:** $y=k−p$
    
    - **Axis of Symmetry:** $x=h$
    
    - If **$p>0$**, the parabola opens **up**.
    
    - If **$p<0$**, the parabola opens **down**.
    
- **Standard Form:** $y=ax^2+bx+c$
    
    - To find the vertex from this form, use the formula for the x-coordinate: $h=−2ab​.$
    
    - Then, plug that x-value back into the equation to find the y-coordinate: $k=f(h)$.

#### **Horizontal Parabolas (Opening Right or Left)**

The variable that is squared is **y**.

- **Vertex Form:** $(y−k)^2=4p(x−h)$
    
    - **Vertex:** $(h,k)$
    
    - **Focus:** $(h+p,k)$
    
    - **Directrix:** $x=h−p$
    
    - **Axis of Symmetry:** $y=k$
    
    - If **$p>0$**, the parabola opens **right**.
    
    - If **$p<0$**, the parabola opens **left**.

| **Focus**            | Add $p$ to the y-coordinate of the vertex: $(h, k+p)$ | Add $p$ to the x-coordinate of the vertex: $(h+p, k)$ |
